# Description of the Model

This repository describes kinematics of shoulder joint which is highly complex with multiple internal joints rather than conventional 3 DOF ball joint model. The pointing kinematics are important part of rehabilitation exercise. An analytical method is presented here to perform pointing kinematics.

The video below shows a simple trajectory followed by 5-DOF shoulder joint showing abduction/adduction motion which is viewed from a plane.

# Graphic Mockup

A library of graphical and computational tools has been written in order to simplify the analysis and to provide a sophisticated and effective mockup.
